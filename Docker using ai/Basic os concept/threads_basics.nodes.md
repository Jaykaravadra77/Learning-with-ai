# Thread Basics

## 1. What is a Thread?

### Basic Concept
- Smallest unit of execution within a process
- Like a worker in a process's workspace
- Shares process resources but runs independently
- Every process has at least one thread (main thread)
-A thread is a program execution unit that runs instructions within a process.

### Node.js Thread Model
1. **Main Thread (Event Loop)**
   - Executes JavaScript code
   - Handles event queue
   - Manages callbacks
   - Runs synchronous operations

2. **Thread Pool (libuv)**
   - Default 4 threads
   - Handles I/O operations
   - Manages CPU-intensive tasks
   - Used by internal Node.js operations

### Practical Example
javascript
// Example showing single vs multi-threaded operation
function calculateFactorial(n) {
if (n === 0 || n === 1) return 1;
return n calculateFactorial(n - 1);
}
// 1. Runs on Main Thread (Event Loop)
console.log('Starting calculation...');
calculateFactorial(5); // Blocks the main thread
// 2. I/O Operation (Uses Thread Pool)
const fs = require('fs');
fs.readFile('input.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
// This runs in thread pool
console.log('File read complete');
});
// 3. Server (Non-blocking I/O)
const http = require('http');
http.createServer((req, res) => {
res.end('Hello');
}).listen(3000);


### Thread vs Process
1. **Resource Sharing**
   - Threads share process memory
   - Threads share code segment
   - Each thread has own stack
   - Each thread has own registers

2. **Key Differences**
   - Threads are lighter than processes
   - Thread creation is faster
   - Thread switching is cheaper
   - Threads share resources

### Node.js Threading Considerations
1. **Single-Threaded Nature**
   - JavaScript code runs on one main thread
   - Long calculations block event loop
   - I/O operations use thread pool
   - Worker threads for CPU-intensive tasks

2. **When to Use Additional Threads**
   - CPU-intensive calculations
   - Parallel processing needs
   - Heavy computational tasks
   - Background processing

### Best Practices
1. **Main Thread**
   - Keep event loop unblocked
   - Avoid long synchronous operations
   - Use async operations when possible
   - Monitor event loop lag

2. **Thread Pool**
   - Don't block thread pool
   - Monitor thread pool usage
   - Configure pool size if needed
   - Use worker threads for CPU work


   ## 2. Thread vs Process

### Basic OS Concept

#### Technical Definition
// Process: Independent execution unit
struct process {
pid_t pid; // Process ID
void memory_space; // Own memory space
file_descriptor fd_table; // Own file descriptors
thread threads; // At least one thread
};
// Thread: Lightweight unit within process
struct thread {
tid_t tid; // Thread ID
pid_t parent_pid; // Parent process ID
void stack; // Own stack
void shared_memory; // Shared with process
};


#### How It Works
1. **Process**
   - Complete independent program
   - Has own memory space
   - Contains at least one thread
   - Heavy resource allocation

2. **Thread**
   - Part of a process
   - Shares process memory
   - Lightweight execution unit
   - Fast creation and switching

### Node.js Implementation
javascript
// 1. Process Example (Heavy, Independent)
const { fork } = require('child_process');
const newProcess = fork('worker.js');
newProcess.send({ data: 'hello' }); // IPC needed
// 2. Thread Example (Light, Shared)
const { Worker } = require('worker_threads');
const newThread = new Worker('./worker.js');
newThread.postMessage({ data: 'hello' }); // Direct communication


### Best Practices

#### 1. Process Usage
- Separate, independent tasks
- Need memory isolation
- Different program execution
- System-level operations

#### 2. Thread Usage
- Shared memory tasks
- CPU-intensive operations
- Parallel computations
- Background processing

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Process Issues
1. **Memory Overhead**
   - Each process needs own memory
   - Solution: Use threads for shared tasks

2. **Communication Complexity**
   - IPC required
   - Solution: Use message passing patterns

#### Thread Issues
1. **Race Conditions**
   - Shared memory conflicts
   - Solution: Use proper synchronization

2. **Resource Contention**
   - Multiple threads accessing same resource
   - Solution: Implement proper locking

 

### Real-World Analogy
- **Process** = Different offices in a building
  - Own space and resources
  - Independent operation
  - Separate budget/memory

- **Thread** = Workers in same office
  - Share office space/resources
  - Collaborate closely
  - Quick communication


#### Key Points:
1. **Main Thread (Event Loop)**
   - Single-threaded execution
   - Handles all JavaScript code
   - Manages Network I/O
   - Non-blocking by design

2. **Thread Pool Operations**
   - File System operations
   - CPU-intensive tasks
   - Runs in background
   - Doesn't block main thread

3. **Important Distinction**
   - Network I/O ≠ Thread Pool
   - File I/O = Thread Pool
   - CPU Tasks = Thread Pool


## 3. Single-threaded vs Multi-threaded
### Basic OS Concept

#### What is a Core?
- Physical processing unit in CPU
- Can execute instructions independently
- Modern CPUs have multiple cores
- Each core can run threads

bash
CPU Structure:
├── Core 0
│ ├── ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)
│ └── Control Unit
├── Core 1
├── Core 2
└── Core 3


#### Single-threaded vs Multi-threaded Execution
1. **Single-threaded**
   - One thread of execution
   - Sequential processing
   - Uses one core primarily
   - Simple but potentially blocking

2. **Multi-threaded**
   - Multiple threads of execution
   - Parallel processing
   - Can use multiple cores
   - Complex but efficient

### Node.js Implementation

#### Default Behavior (Single-threaded)

javascript
// Basic Node.js application
const app = express();
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
// Runs in single thread (Event Loop)
res.send('Hello');
});



#### Core Usage in Node.js
1. **Without Clustering**
   - Main Thread (Event Loop)
   - Thread Pool (4 threads)
   - Still primarily single-threaded for JavaScript
   - System operations may use multiple cores

2. **With Clustering**
javascript
// Using multiple cores
const cluster = require('cluster');
if (cluster.isPrimary) {
// Fork for each CPU core
for (let i = 0; i < os.cpus().length; i++) {
cluster.fork();
}
}


### Parallel Processing Options

#### 1. Clustering
javascript
// Multiple processes
const cluster = require('cluster');
Characteristics:
Separate memory space
Good for HTTP server scaling
Process level isolation
Inter-Process Communication (IPC)



#### 2. Worker Threads
javascript
// Multiple threads
const { Worker } = require('worker_threads');
Characteristics:
Shared memory space
Good for CPU intensive tasks
Thread level execution
Direct communication


#### 3. Separate Compute Server
javascript
// API Server
app.post('/calculate', async (req, res) => {
const result = await axios.post(
'compute-server/calculate',
req.body
);
res.json(result.data);
});
Characteristics:
Complete separation
Independent scaling
Simple architecture
Clear responsibility division



### Best Practices

#### 1. When to Use Single-threaded
- Simple applications
- I/O bound operations
- Light computational load
- Basic CRUD operations

#### 2. When to Use Multi-threaded
- CPU intensive tasks
- Heavy computations
- High concurrency needs
- Parallel processing requirements

#### 3. Choosing the Right Approach

javascript
const choosingApproach = {
clustering: {
use: "HTTP server scaling",
when: "High concurrent requests"
},
workerThreads: {
use: "CPU intensive tasks",
when: "Need shared memory"
},
computeServer: {
use: "Heavy computations",
when: "Need simple architecture"
}
};



### Common Issues & Solutions

#### 1. Single-threaded Issues
- Blocking operations
- Limited to one core
- Performance bottlenecks
- Long processing times

Solution:
javascript
// Move heavy tasks to:
Worker Threads
Separate Process
Compute Server


### Key Takeaways
1. Node.js is single-threaded by default
2. System operations can use multiple cores
3. Use clustering for HTTP scaling
4. Use worker threads for CPU tasks
5. Consider separate compute server for simplicity
6. Choose based on application needs

 
 ## 4. Thread States

### Basic Concept
A thread during its lifecycle moves through different states from creation to termination.

### Thread State Diagram
NEW ──────┐
▼
READY ⟷ RUNNING
▲ │
└─ BLOCKED
│
▼
TERMINATED



### Common State Transitions

1. **NEW → READY**
   - Thread is started
   - Resources allocated
   - Ready for execution

2. **READY → RUNNING**
   - CPU scheduler selects thread
   - Thread gets CPU time
   - Begins execution

3. **RUNNING → BLOCKED**
   - Thread requests I/O
   - Waits for resources
   - Releases CPU

4. **BLOCKED → READY**
   - I/O complete
   - Resources available
   - Ready to run again

5. **RUNNING → TERMINATED**
   - Execution complete
   - Resources released
   - Cannot be restarted

### Best Practices

1. **State Management**
   - Monitor thread states
   - Handle blocked threads
   - Clean up terminated threads

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Minimize blocking operations
   - Balance thread creation
   - Handle state transitions efficiently

3. **Error Handling**
javascript
worker.on('error', (error) => {
console.error('Thread error:', error);
// Handle different states appropriately
});


### Key Points
1. Threads move through multiple states
2. Each state has specific characteristics
3. State transitions are managed by OS
4. Understanding states helps in debugging
5. Proper state handling improves performance

## 5. Thread Scheduling

### Basic Concept
Thread scheduling determines which thread runs next and for how long on the CPU.

### Scheduling Components
├── Ready Queue (Threads waiting for CPU)
├── Scheduling Algorithm (How to choose next thread)
└── Time Slice (CPU time allocated per thread)


### Scheduling Algorithms

#### 1. Round Robin (RR)
- Each thread gets equal time slice
- Runs in circular order
- Fair CPU distribution

#### 2. Priority Scheduling
- Threads with higher priority get more CPU time
- Lower priority threads wait longer
- Useful for critical tasks

#### 3. Multi-level Feedback Queue (MLFQ)
- Multiple queues with different priorities
- Threads move between queues based on performance
- Adaptive scheduling


### Real-World Example: PowerPoint and Excel

#### Scenario
bash
User Activities:
Editing PowerPoint presentation
Calculating data in Excel
Both running simultaneously on CPU
