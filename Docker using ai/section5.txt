# STORAGE IN DOCKER

## 1. Volumes
Volumes are Docker's preferred mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by containers. Think of them as external hard drives for your containers.

Key Features:
├── Managed by Docker
├── Independent of container lifecycle 
├── Can be shared between containers
└── Easy backup and migration

## 2. Bind Mounts
Direct mapping between host system and container filesystem. Think of it as a shared folder between your computer and container.

Key Features:
├── Direct host filesystem access
├── Not managed by Docker
├── Great for development
└── Real-time file changes

Common Uses:
├── Local development
├── Configuration files
└── Source code mounting

## 3. tmpfs Mounts
Temporary file storage that only persists in the host memory. Think of it as RAM disk that clears on container stop.

Key Features:
├── Stored in memory only
├── Never written to disk
├── Temporary storage
└── High performance

Common Uses:
├── Sensitive data
├── Session storage
├── Temporary calculations
└── Fast I/O operations

## Storage Type Comparison

1. Volumes
   ├── Best for: Production data
   ├── Persistence: Yes
   └── Management: Docker

2. Bind Mounts
   ├── Best for: Development
   ├── Persistence: Yes (on host)
   └── Management: Manual

3. tmpfs Mounts
   ├── Best for: Sensitive/temp data
   ├── Persistence: No
   └── Management: Automatic cleanup

Remember:
- Volumes for persistent data
- Bind mounts for development
- tmpfs for temporary storage

# NETWORKING IN DOCKER

## Network Types
Docker provides different types of networks for container communication.

1. Bridge Network (Default)
   ├── Private internal network
   ├── Containers can communicate
   ├── Default for containers
   └── Isolated environment

2. Host Network
   ├── Uses host's network directly
   ├── No network isolation
   ├── Better performance
   └── Less security

3. None Network
   ├── No network access
   ├── Complete isolation
   └── Security-focused cases

4. Overlay Network
   ├── Multi-host networking
   ├── Swarm mode
   └── Distributed applications

## Network Features
Key Capabilities:
├── Container DNS
│   └── Automatic name resolution
├── Port Mapping
│   └── Access to container services
├── Network Isolation
│   └── Security between containers
└── Service Discovery
    └── Find other containers

## Common Use Cases
1. Microservices
   ├── Service communication
   └── API interactions

2. Web Applications
   ├── Frontend to Backend
   └── Database connections

3. Multi-Container Apps
   ├── Service orchestration
   └── Container cooperation

## Best Practices
Network Guidelines:
├── Use custom networks
├── Plan network topology
├── Secure exposed ports
└── Monitor traffic

Remember:
- Bridge for single-host networking
- Host for direct network access
- None for network isolation
- Overlay for multi-host setups

## Network vs Storage Comparison
1. Networks
   ├── Container communication
   ├── Service discovery
   └── Port management

2. Storage
   ├── Data persistence
   ├── File sharing
   └── Resource management
