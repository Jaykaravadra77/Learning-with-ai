DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)

1. Real-World Example: Hotel Reception
   ├── Guest (Device) arrives at hotel (Network)
   ├── Reception (DHCP Server) assigns:
   │   ├── Room number (IP Address)
   │   ├── Room key (Network Access)
   │   ├── Hotel map (Gateway/Router info)
   │   └── Local services guide (DNS info)
   │
   └── When guest leaves:
       └── Room becomes available for next guest
           (IP address returns to pool)

2. Real-World Example: Parking Lot
   ├── Cars (Devices) enter parking lot (Network)
   ├── Ticket machine (DHCP) assigns:
   │   ├── Parking spot number (IP Address)
   │   ├── Parking duration (Lease Time)
   │   └── Parking rules (Network Config)
   │
   └── When car leaves:
       └── Spot becomes available for next car

3. Real-World Example: Library
   ├── Student (Device) enters library (Network)
   ├── Librarian (DHCP) provides:
   │   ├── Desk number (IP Address)
   │   ├── Building access (Network Access)
   │   ├── Directory info (DNS Servers)
   │   └── Study time limit (Lease Time)
   │
   └── When student leaves:
       └── Desk available for next student

4. DHCP Process (DORA) Like Restaurant:
   ├── Discovery: "Any tables available?"
   ├── Offer: "Yes, table 7 is free"
   ├── Request: "I'll take table 7"
   └── Acknowledgment: "Table 7 is yours"

5. Where is DHCP?
   ├── Home: Inside your Router
   ├── Office: Dedicated Server
   └── Public WiFi: Network Controller
